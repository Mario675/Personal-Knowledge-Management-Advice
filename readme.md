Here's an introduction to a knowledge storing system. It's a train of thought drafted in advance from multiple different sources.

_preface_
this is a long term cheat sheet of knowledge storing. Understand at your own pace. Feel free to ask questions, copy and modify to take notes and extend at your hearts content.
This is also useful for I and others. I guess another way of learning again, is teaching what one knows.

## What is obsidian
Obsidian is a program that is focused on plain-text markdown files, and linking those files together.
It tries to support a system that mimics the brain in 'concepts'. Like "that reminds me of abc".

## What is markdown
Simplistic formatting that gets the job done. You are looking at it right now.
```md
# Header 1
## Header 2
### Header 3

*italics* _italics_
**bold** __bold__

/```the syntax program to highlight code.
Your code here. You are looking at an example inside of a formatted markdown example. That's how one makes this example. He he.
Right now it is escaped by slashes so that the rest of it highlights and it doesn't get confused.
/```

More info here: cheat sheet: 
https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet

Some make points to it as "it's being used for writing papers", and "less time spent on fussing with word format".

The epic part is that markdown can be **converted** into different formats! PDF, .docx, GitHub, etc. Select the converter template, and the documents looks nice and pretty.

## How would I take notes?
See school notes below for visual reference and examples. This section is a collage of not only my knowledge and human factor, but also stuff from the LYT kit.
"Back in days of yore, everything that was mentioned was noted down, because everything the teacher said must have been important." Paraphrased from the obsidian video.
Some highlighted an observed process of taking notes, then making notes, then something else...
But for your situation, here's what *might* work for your long term knowledge database.

The following is highly inspired from the LYT kit. (The LYT kit is a self journey of obsidian notes. Something of intrinsic value to explore. I'll highlight what I found useful, and I know)
One doesn't need a organization system from the start. Wait until at least it starts getting hard to find one's note again. They say about 300 files, but then come back. But I like to learn about the system from the ground up, since I already have a lot that I've gathered that I'd like to note.

This system has a name. It's called Zettelkasten. Now one can search it up on the internet and get lots of information. But that may not lead to useful, applicable knowledge. Apply discretion to information.

The system discourages segregation into notes via folders, to allow for the discovery and linking of notes. Constraints such as Year 2005, grade11, phycology class folder.
Rather, it encourages concepts. For example, inertia. Inertia can be a file containing not only your short definition of understanding, but could also contain a copy and paste from the wiki page. Inertia can be a concept for `## economics, ## physics, etc`. It's a concept that talks about how it can be used. 

__extra info__
> While the wiki pages goal is to note down every specific iota of information, you don't have to do that. You can note down what is important, and what makes sense for you, and exclude the rest.
> The LYT mentions copying articles and quotes as clippings. It discourages this fact. I'll look back on it later, to be more concise on this line.

Alright, so far: Obsidian is a plain markdown text editor, focused on linking concepts.

## What is the strategies to use such tools?

The LYT talks about the Zettelkasten method, or something about it. I didn't study much about that. But here are the concepts I know.

Folders that organize things for a very specific purpose (Bins, spaces), MOC (Map of content).

### School use:
Take your in class notes, the one when thyself was in a rush to capture ideas. Rehash them, in your understanding, in concise format in 'concepts'. 

Here's a timestamped linked video that starts in a chapter "how you should take notes". It's also the video that I refereed to at the beginning and what I know during this train of thought. It might be more useful for visual examples as well.
https://youtu.be/MYJsGksojms?t=128

He also talked about information of 'USE' or unimportant, self explanatory, Easy enough to memorize.

It's also useful to predict in your head how the teacher was going about the lesson in your head. It's good for actually assessing what you've picked up, and what you actually know, rather than just copying information without learning. He also mentioned not to write down the examples, but instead to sit back and predict what he would do next -- actually, just watch the video at 3:16 to end of chapter. That'll explain it better.

### map of content
Let's dive into an example.
Main pad > general topic ("disciplines" or classes) > concepts.
```md
# MAIN MOC
- [[physical education]]
- [[geology]]
- [[art]]
- [[history]]

# physical education
- [[Stretching]]
- [[Exercising]]

# Exercising
General Description may not even be needed, there's already common definitions of the word, just copy and paste it.
- [[Vigorous exercise]]
- [[The gym of life]] (Not just bikes)
- [[Biking]] (Techniques of petalling a different way for stamina)
- [[Swimming]] (About how the legs kind of drag one behind, getting comfortable with the water)
```

Note that with each `# Main topic header` is a title of a 'map'. And the content inside of it links to other content. It's a 'map' of 'content'.
It's made to easily group together, and organize subjects, without the need for folders, while still staying flexible.

It doesn't matter where the folders for files are, they are linked and organized in a flexible manner.

### Linking
A link is make in obsidian by `[[file]]`. This is clickable and referable in one way. 
It's purpose is to flexibly point to a topic, without copying or rehashing it to mention it.
"The situation I've encountered the other day sound like the person had [[eggs in one basket]] problems!" And then in obsidian, one can click on the link, and receive your notes about the all the eggs in a basket."
It's also provides another opportunity to enjoy your notes, and revise them later on! Yay! 
> reduces rediscovering, and rehashing. All colors in one bucket.

### Tags:
It's a way of tagging similar files together so they can be searched earlier. I don't tag much, but it seems useful to mention it.
Example:
```md
%% tags:: #idiom %%
# Beating around the bush,
# Hitting the nail on the head
# don't burn your bridges.

All these `#h1` headers are separate files. Thus if one wanted to search for idioms, it would be easy to find them again.
```

### Organizing in heterarchal order

Instead of frustrating yourself with 
1. topic
2. topic
3. topic
and then having to reorganize them and retype them, try: 
topic
topic
topic
Now it is easy to copy and paste these things around, or just not needed to do so in the first place.

If one wants alphabetical order to view, just make a tag search, and the computer will put them in alphabetical order automatically.
Heterarchy is also an example of a map of content. 


### The use of folders. (This section may seem long and exhaustive, but just gloss over and read as much as I've copied from the author as you wish.)
__Summary__
It's a space to store away notes after they are newly created. When new files are created, they are in the default of the root directory of the vault. When done, drag and drop.  

The most useful folder I've found of use thus far is the umami folder. I've not used the spaces folder, since I like to store projects separate from my vault.

My own folder that I put in there, is called _data dumps_. Why? Because I'm lazy, and don't want to take more notes when the video I've watched perfectly explains the topic for me, and I don't need instant access to it, like text, but find extremely useful to have offline and study later (Example: The Hated One - how to protect your online privacy with a threat model). I put YouTube videos there, and downloaded HTML websites as well (Vim study articles, general Linux notes, just technical stuff that really covers a topic, and I'm lazy to note such things down). I also put my latest folder called "school2022". Why did I make a folder like that? It's because I want to separate my concept and link vault, from the assignments, and specific notes that heavily rely on convenience, and folder context. Later on, I'll separate these and organize them into my vault. That way I still organize visual arts class, and make project notes, and general notes. I can then Incorporate those general notes, lessons and reflections into my main vault.

-- Below is a further elaboration of summary from me and the author, further explaining about these different types of folders he implemented, forged out of practicality --

__Umami__
Any individual piece of knowledge that gets thrown in one bucket. I'll copy a definition of it here:
```md
"
This folder is called "Umami" because of its mysteriousness. Apparently umami is one of the five basic tastes. There are: Sweetness, Sourness, Saltiness, Bitterness, and that oddball Umami.

Umami is hard to describe but you know when it's there. The same is true of this folder's contents. It's a mixture of insights and ideas, concepts and connections, all mingling together to create that mysterious full mouthfeel that magnificently completes any meal for the mind. 
"
- LYT kit

and more if it helps:
"
### Knowledge Umami can encourage wise behavior
Information is everywhere. 

> It is in a book / it is in a nook / it's absolutely everywhere we look. 

Information is all around us. 

Once we have a relationship with any bit of information—consciously or subconsciously—that information becomes knowledge.

Said another way: Information that crosses our attentional filter becomes knowledge.

With enough knowledge, experience, and "connecting-the-dots" that comes from living; we form patterns of insights, heuristics, and helpful models of the world. The better we get, the more complex patterns we are able to chunk into bite size bits that we can act upon. 

Pattern recognition alone doesn’t make us wise, but it gets us closer to wisdom. It opens the door to acting with more of that cumulative **umami** we might call wisdom.

All from making sense—over time—of countless bits of information.
"

- LYT kit.
```

__spaces__
I'll let the definition speak for itself:
```md
"Spaces" is more flexible than saying "projects" and more versatile than saying "areas".

Spaces can house: 

- shared folders for collaboration
- special folders to share publicly
- big hard-to-define things
- and whatever else demands its own space!
```

__bins__
A meta folder to host your default Images folder. One can make it default by right clicking on it, and setting it to default. One can organize by folder, and by naming the images. LYT kit did. Didn't have a lot of images.
Other directories are:
People, private (financial, medical), templates, zArchive.

__timestamps__
This is where day to day notes go. One can use the default calendar plugin or get the calendar plugin. Just click the day, it makes a note with a timestamp. 
For I, I prefer to just have one convenient file in which I can quickly make notes and refer back to. I use a drop-down terminal, and use a bash alias with vim to open the file.  I prefer a quickness to my notes, more about shortcuts, rather than interacting with a graphics user interface, with the mouse.
The advantages of having daily notes in obsidian is that one can link them. I still prefer a quick notes and refer text edit over this, though.

__sources__
Web clipping from web articles. The author of the LYT kit notes that it may corrupt and drown one's personal knowledge sanctuary with hordes of low value articles, and drowns one's own thinking like a pit like chaos.

He further elaborates that there is a delicate balance between making notes, and just copying whole articles on the concept.
